**Collection of Swift/iOS-related conference videos**.

This project serves as a showcase for **the SuperArc project (TSP)**. 

**TSP** aims to standardize many common building blocks which can help developers to kickstart new iOS projects quickly.

The goal is to have a set of modules to create a component-based MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) architecture for iOS apps. The modules are intended to use together but each module should be able to be integrated into any other iOS projects. For more information about the SuperArc project, please take a look at [here](https://github.com/superarcswift/SwiftVideos).
